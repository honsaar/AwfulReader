# Awful Reads
Reader for Lparchive.org (unofficial)

## What? Why?
LetsReader is a tool that provides a different, less cluttered UI for the Lets Play Archive with better mobile UI support.

This is an unofficial project, and done for my own uses rather than as an extension to the official platform.
